I am a PhD student in CS at UMD College Park, where I am advised by Prof. [Jonathan Katz](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/). My research interest is in secure multi-party computation.

Previously, I was a research fellow in [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) group at Microsoft Research India, advised by Dr. [Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/), Dr. [Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/) and Dr. [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/).

I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee. During my undergrad, I was a part of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), a group of enthusiastic students who constantly try to deliver some amazing applications. 

I enjoy playing Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions. I am currently part of the team [CVE2K9](https://cve.gay). I like to solve crypto and rev challenges.
