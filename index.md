I am Kanav. Currently I am a research fellow in [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) group at Microsoft Research India. My current research interests include Theoretical Cryptography and Secure Multi-Party Computation.

I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee. During my undergrad, I was a part of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), a group of enthusiastic students who constantly try to deliver some amazing applications. I enjoy playing Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions, sometimes as a part of team SDSLabs.
