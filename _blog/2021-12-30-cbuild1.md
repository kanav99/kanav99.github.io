title: Killing headers from C - Part 1 
---

I love C. More than any compiled languages. It feels natural for Linux and ELF binaries. One thing I don't like about C, and don't know why this problem is existant in C++, is header files. Build systems of Rust and Go propose a good model for projects. Just a `pub` makes a function/variable public to outer world.

But I don't want to mess with GCC. So here is what I propose - autogenerate header files from `.c` files. A new keyword `pub` moves a function/variable/struct declaration to the header file. The WIP project is available at [kanav99/cbuild](https://github.com/kanav99/cbuild).

Currently I am working/have implemented only limited features. 
- No macros other than `#include`
- No function declarations in `.c` files.
- Everything is public

Hope this doesn't become my Yet Another Side Project.
