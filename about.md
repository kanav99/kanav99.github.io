I am Kanav. Currently I am a research fellow in [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) group at Microsoft Research India. I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee. I like all things retro and hacking into things. I love solving challenging problems. I was a part of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), a group of enthusiastic students who constantly try to deliver some really great apps. I still participate in CTFs on behalf of the group.

I hail from New Delhi, currently living here due to quarantine. I did my studies from Kendriya Vidyalaya, first Koliwada then AGCR. My father got me a computer at a very young age and have been playing around with it since then.
