I am Kanav. I am a final year computer science undergraduate at IIT Roorkee. I like all things retro and hacking into things. I love solving challenging problems. I am a developer at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), a group of enthusiastic students who constantly try to deliver some really great apps. I also participate in CTFs on behalf of the group.

I hail from New Delhi, currently living here due to quarantine. I did my studies from Kendriya Vidyalaya, first Koliwada then AGCR. My father got me a computer at a very young age and have been playing around with it since then.
